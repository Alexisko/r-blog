<p>I recently stumbled upon a great data source on Game of Thrones, it lead me to spend (lose) some (a lot) time playing around with it.
The data comes from here : <a href="https://github.com/jeffreylancaster/game-of-thrones" class="uri">https://github.com/jeffreylancaster/game-of-thrones</a> with some very neat visualisations already.</p>
<p>I was very excited, first thing to do get the data into tidy format :
I import the data from github, at the moment I am intersted in scene details : characters involved, location, duration etc…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(jsonlite)
library(here)
library(lubridate)
library(here)

got &lt;- fromJSON(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffreylancaster/game-of-thrones/master/data/episodes.json&quot;)

scenes &lt;- got$episodes %&gt;%
  as_tibble() %&gt;% 
  select(-episodeLink,
         -episodeAirDate,
         -episodeDescription,
         -openingSequenceLocations) %&gt;% 
  unnest(scenes) %&gt;% 
  group_by(seasonNum, episodeNum, episodeTitle) %&gt;% 
  mutate(sceneNum = 1,
         sceneNum = cumsum(sceneNum)) %&gt;% 
  unnest(characters) %&gt;% 
  select(seasonNum,
         episodeNum,
         episodeTitle,
         sceneNum,
         sceneStart,
         sceneEnd,
         location,
         subLocation,
         name) %&gt;% 
  ungroup() %&gt;% 
  mutate(sceneStart = hms(sceneStart),
         sceneEnd = hms(sceneEnd),
         time = seconds(sceneEnd - sceneStart) %&gt;% as.numeric())


write_csv(scenes, here(&quot;static/inputs/got/data_prep.csv&quot;))</code></pre>

extrafont::loadfonts(device = &quot;win&quot;)

got &lt;- read_csv(here(&quot;static/inputs/got/data_prep.csv&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>I used hrbrthemes because the default theme is great, I particularly like the font size default which is really convenient.
I don’t think a legend is needed as colors are in order.</p>
