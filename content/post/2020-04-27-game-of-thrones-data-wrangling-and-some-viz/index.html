<p>I recently stumbled upon a great data source on Game of Thrones, it lead me to spend (lose) some (a lot of) time playing around with it.</p>
<p>The data comes from here : <a href="https://github.com/jeffreylancaster/game-of-thrones" class="uri">https://github.com/jeffreylancaster/game-of-thrones</a> with some very neat visualisations already.</p>
<div id="first-lets-get-the-data-into-a-tidy-format" class="section level2">
<h2>First let’s get the data into a tidy format</h2>
<p>The data comes as a json file. Let’s tidy it, for the moment I am intersted in scene details : characters involved, location, duration etc…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)

got &lt;- read_csv(here(&quot;static/inputs/got/data_prep.csv&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>I used hrbrthemes because the default theme is great, I particularly like the font size default which is really convenient.
I don’t think a legend is needed as colors are in order.</p>
