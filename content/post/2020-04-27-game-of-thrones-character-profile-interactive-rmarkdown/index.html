<p>I had experienced with Shiny App a few times in the past, with the <a href="/post/game-of-thrones-data-wrangling-and-some-viz/">Game of Thrones data</a> I built for the first time a Shiny Rmarkdown document.<!--more--></p>
<p>You can find the code at the end. I wanted to do some minor modification before publishing it here, but I updated R to version 4.0.0 and for now shinyapps.io do not seem willing to work with that.</p>
<p><em>It may take a few seconds to load. Only suitable to be seen on large screen</em></p>

<p><em>The upset plot shows only combination with 20 other characters, it means that combination between n characters include also combination with more characters that are not in those 20. I might change that down the line by including a level “other” but for now I cannot update the document</em></p>
